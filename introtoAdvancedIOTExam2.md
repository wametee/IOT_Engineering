## üß© Section A: IoT Foundations and Ecosystem (20 marks)

**(5 marks)** Using the concept of the IoT ecosystem, explain how a smart veterinary hospital could integrate:
- IoT-enabled pet collars (heart rate & temperature sensors),
- RFID-enabled patient records, and
- a cloud-based AI dashboard for veterinarians.
Draw and label a block diagram showing devices, connectivity, data processing, and user interface layers.

**(5 marks)** Differentiate between IoT, Industrial IoT (IIoT), and Human IoT (HIoT).
For each, give a real-world African example (e.g., precision agriculture in Kenya, wearable health IoT in South Africa, logistics tracking in Nigeria).

**(5 marks)** Explain how low-power embedded systems and energy harvesting technologies (like solar-powered sensors) could extend the life of devices in:
- Smart cattle collars in remote areas of Turkana County, and
- Air quality sensors deployed in Nairobi‚Äôs central business district.

**(5 marks)** Compare the evolution of IoT (1982‚Äì2025) to the evolution of mobile computing.
What major innovations bridged IoT‚Äôs early limitations (like limited bandwidth and interoperability)?

## üîå Section B: Devices, Sensors, and Connectivity (20 marks)

**(5 marks)** Design an IoT system for a Smart Coffee Plantation in Kericho that automates irrigation and monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
Identify the types of sensors, connectivity technologies, and cloud platform you would use.

**(5 marks)** PetSmart Technologies plans to build an IoT collar that monitors pets‚Äô vital signs and sends alerts via mobile apps.
Describe:
- Two sensors and one actuator suitable for the collar.
- The connectivity protocol most appropriate for real-time alerts.
- How latency can be minimized using edge computing.

**(5 marks)** A real estate developer wants to implement smart lighting and energy optimization across 200 apartments.
Compare Zigbee, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in terms of range, power consumption, and scalability.
Which would you recommend and why?

**(5 marks)** An IoT-enabled hospital uses wearable ECG sensors connected to cloud analytics systems.

Label communication protocols at each stage (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, HTTP).

**(10 marks)** Explain how edge computing can be used to detect health anomalies in pets before data reaches the cloud.
Include a real-world example of model deployment (e.g., TensorFlow Lite on ESP32).
What are the trade-offs in terms of cost, latency, and data privacy?

**(10 marks)** Compare Cloud IoT Platforms:
- AWS IoT Core,
- Azure IoT Hub, and
- Google Cloud IoT Core.
Choose one platform for:
- a national livestock tracking project in Kenya, and
- a human health monitoring network for hospitals.
Justify your choice based on scalability, latency, and compliance.

## üîê Section D: IoT Security, Privacy, and Ethics (20 marks)

**(5 marks)** A startup developing IoT smart locks for homes faces frequent hacking attempts.
Identify three major security vulnerabilities and propose corresponding countermeasures (e.g., TLS encryption, firmware signing, two-factor authentication).

**(5 marks)** In the Petinder system, pet health data is stored in the cloud.
Discuss the implications of data privacy under GDPR or Kenya‚Äôs Data Protection Act.
Who owns the pet‚Äôs data ‚Äî the owner, the vet, or the platform provider?

**(5 marks)** A wearable glucose monitor transmits health data to a mobile app.
Describe a secure data pipeline using encryption, authentication, and anonymization, from sensor to cloud.

**(5 marks)** Explain how blockchain could enhance transparency and data integrity in an IoT-based food supply chain, from farm to supermarket.
