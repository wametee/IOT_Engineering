# Basics of Computer Networking

_Last Updated: 18 Sep, 2025_

## Introduction
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that share resources and information. These devices include computers, servers, printers, and other hardware. Networks enable efficient data exchange, supporting applications such as email, file sharing, and internet browsing. As a senior IoT engineer with over 30 years of experience, I emphasize that robust networking is foundational to scalable, secure, and reliable systems.

## Basic Terminologies of Computer Networks

- **Network:** A group of connected computers and devices that can communicate and share data with each other.
- **Node:** Any device that can send, receive, or forward data in a network (e.g., laptops, mobiles, printers, earbuds, servers).
- **Networking Devices:** Hardware that manages and supports networking functions (routers, switches, hubs, access points).
- **Transmission Media:** The physical or wireless medium through which data travels between devices.
  - _Wired media:_ Ethernet cables, optical fiber.
  - _Wireless media:_ Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared.
- **Service Provider Networks:** Networks offered by external providers, allowing users or organizations to lease network access and capabilities (internet providers, mobile carriers).

## How Does a Computer Network Work?

The basic building blocks of a computer network are **nodes** and **links**.

- **Network Node:** Any device in a network (modem, router, computer) that sends or receives data.
- **Link:** The medium connecting nodes (cables, wires, wireless signals).
- **Protocols:** Networks use rules (protocols) to send and receive data between devices. Each device is identified by a unique IP address.
- **Firewall:** A security tool (hardware/software) that monitors traffic and allows, blocks, or drops data based on set rules.

## Types of Computer Network Architecture

- **Client-Server Architecture:** Nodes can be servers or clients. The server node manages client node behavior, centralizing control and resources.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture:** No central server; each device can act as both client and server, enabling decentralized resource sharing.

## Network Devices

Computer networks rely on various devices to enable communication and manage data flow:

1. **Router**
   - Connects multiple networks (e.g., home network to the internet).
   - Directs data packets to their correct destination.
2. **Switch**
   - Connects devices within a network (e.g., computers in an office).
   - Forwards data only to the specific device it is meant for.
3. **Hub**
   - Basic device that connects multiple devices in a network.
   - Sends data to all devices (less efficient than a switch).
4. **Bridge**
   - Connects and filters traffic between two networks or segments.
   - Helps reduce network traffic.
5. **Gateway**
   - Connects two different types of networks.
   - Translates data between different protocols.
6. **Access Point (AP)**
   - Provides wireless connectivity to devices.
   - Extends a wired network into a Wi-Fi network.
7. **Modem**
   - Converts digital data from a computer into signals for phone/cable lines and vice versa.
   - Provides internet access.
8. **Firewall**
   - Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
   - Provides security by blocking unauthorized access.

## Goals of Networks

- **Convenience:** Simplifies computer use for users.
- **Efficiency:** Manages hardware resources for optimal performance.
- **Resource Management:** Allocates CPU, memory, I/O, and storage fairly and efficiently.
- **Security & Protection:** Safeguards data and resources from unauthorized access.
- **Reliability & Fault Tolerance:** Ensures smooth operation and recovery from failures.
- **Scalability:** Supports growth in users, processes, and resources.

## Uses of Computer Networks

- **Communication:** Email, chat, video conferencing.
- **Resource Sharing:** Share printers, scanners, and files to save cost and effort.
- **Remote Access:** Access data and systems from anywhere.
- **Collaboration:** Work together on projects, share ideas, and review work.
- **E-commerce:** Enable online shopping and secure payments.
- **Education:** Support online learning, research, and studentâ€“teacher collaboration.

## Characteristics of Computer Networks

1. **Security**
   - Protects data from unauthorized access, hacking, and viruses.
   - Uses firewalls, encryption, and authentication for safety.
2. **Reliability**
   - Ensures data and resources are always available.
   - Redundancy and backups keep the network running during failures.
3. **Scalability**
   - Ability to grow and handle more devices/users without performance loss.
   - Example: The internet supports millions of new users daily.
4. **High Performance**
   - Fast data transfer, low latency, and high throughput improve user experience.
   - Performance depends on bandwidth, response time, and processing power.
5. **Quality of Service (QoS)**
   - Prioritizes important data for faster delivery.
   - Ensures smooth communication, especially for streaming and video calls.

## Senior Engineer's Perspective

- Always design networks with security, scalability, and reliability in mind.
- Choose devices and media based on application needs, budget, and future growth.
- Document network topology and keep firmware/software updated.
- Monitor performance and plan for redundancy and disaster recovery.
- Stay current with evolving standards and protocols to ensure long-term compatibility.
