## Section A: Core Networking Concepts (20 marks)

**(5 marks)** Compare Clientâ€“Server and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network architectures in the context of:
- a smart home energy management system, and
- a smart farm irrigation system.
Which is more efficient in real-time operations and why?

**(5 marks)** A smart real estate company installs IoT sensors in apartments for energy and motion detection.
- Explain the role of routers, switches, and gateways in ensuring reliable device connectivity.
- Identify one potential point of failure and suggest a redundancy solution.

**(5 marks)** Using the OSI model, map how data from a PetSmart health collar moves from the collar to a veterinarianâ€™s cloud dashboard. Label network devices, transmission media, and protocols.

**(5 marks)** Discuss the trade-offs between wired Ethernet and LoRaWAN in an agriculture IoT setup where sensors are spread across a 20-acre farm.

**(5 marks)** Explain how Zero Trust Architecture can protect both smart homes and hospitals using IoT devices. Include examples of device authentication and micro-segmentation.

**(5 marks)** PetSmart devices transmit pet vitals via Wi-Fi and mobile networks.
- Identify two network vulnerabilities.
- Recommend encryption and authentication methods (e.g., TLS, OAuth 2.0) to secure this data.

**(5 marks)** Compare MQTT, HTTP, and CoAP for use in:
- A smart apartment (temperature and lighting control), and
- A smart poultry farm (feed and humidity monitoring).
Justify which protocol best suits each case.

**(5 marks)** You are tasked to subnet an IoT company network managing:
- 1000 pet collars
- 200 smart home hubs
- 50 medical IoT devices
- 20 farm gateways
Design a subnetting plan and explain how IP addressing enhances scalability and isolation.

## Section C: Real-World Network Design (30 marks)

**(10 marks)** Design a multi-layer IoT network architecture integrating:
- Pet health trackers
- Smart home hubs
- Agricultural sensors
- Hospital IoT monitors
Identify all layers (edge, fog, cloud) and describe how data flows securely between them. Include network devices and communication protocols.

**(10 marks)** In a smart building, residents complain of delayed responses when adjusting thermostats and lights via a mobile app.
- Identify possible network bottlenecks at each layer (device, network, application).
- Suggest technical optimizations using edge computing or QoS prioritization.

**(10 marks)** Design a VPN and firewall architecture that allows veterinarians and farmers to remotely access IoT dashboards securely without compromising local device networks. Include user access control and failover mechanisms.

## Section D: Applied Case Studies (30 marks)

**(10 marks)** A smart agriculture firm notices data discrepancies between soil moisture sensors and the cloud dashboard.
- Propose methods to ensure data reliability and synchronization using caching, MQTT QoS, and timestamps.

**(10 marks)** A real estate developer plans to connect 500 smart apartments, 100 PetSmart devices, and 10 medical monitoring systems to a single cloud network.
- Evaluate the scalability, latency, and security implications.
- Recommend a hybrid architecture (edge + cloud).

**(10 marks)** Describe how AI-driven network optimization could enhance IoT performance across sectors.
Example: Predictive bandwidth allocation for hospitals, pets, and smart home devices during peak hours.
