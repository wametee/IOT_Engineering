# Final Exam – Senior-Level IoT & Computer Networks (Real-World Application Focus)

**Duration:** 3 Hours  **Total Marks:** 100  **Instructions:** Attempt all questions. Show architecture diagrams where necessary. All answers must demonstrate practical IoT + networking integration concepts.

---

## Section A: Core Networking Concepts (20 marks)

**(5 marks)** Explain, with the help of a labeled diagram, how the Client–Server and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architectures differ in their data flow and control. Discuss which is more suitable for large-scale IoT deployments and why.

**(5 marks)** Compare the roles of a Router, Switch, and Gateway in a smart home IoT network where devices include sensors, cameras, and a cloud-based health monitoring dashboard.

**(5 marks)** Given a hospital IoT network, design a logical topology (star, mesh, hybrid, etc.) that supports reliability and low latency. Justify your choice based on performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

**(5 marks)** Differentiate between wired and wireless transmission media for IoT applications. Discuss at least two real-world challenges each medium faces in pet health tracking systems.

## Section B: Network Security & Protocols (20 marks)

**(5 marks)** Explain how firewalls and network segmentation can prevent cyberattacks on connected IoT medical devices. Provide a short case example.

**(5 marks)** Discuss the importance of encryption and authentication in securing IoT data transmission. Which cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS, AES) would you use in PetSmart and why?

**(5 marks)** In IoT networks, devices use lightweight protocols like MQTT, CoAP, and HTTP. Compare these three protocols based on bandwidth usage, reliability, and security.

**(5 marks)** Design a simple IP addressing scheme for an IoT pet-care company managing 500 smart collars, 50 cameras, and 10 servers across two regions. Justify your subnetting strategy.

## Section C: Real-World Design & Analysis (30 marks)

**(10 marks)** You are tasked with designing the PetSmart Cloud IoT Network Architecture.
- Identify each network layer (device, edge, cloud, application).
- Specify the network devices, transmission media, and security layers at each stage.
- Explain how Quality of Service (QoS) ensures smooth data flow for health-critical alerts.

**(10 marks)** Suppose an IoT sensor node in a veterinary clinic sends incorrect temperature data due to network jitter.
- Identify three possible network-level causes.
- Propose mitigation strategies (both software and hardware).

**(10 marks)** Design a secure remote access system for veterinarians using VPNs and firewalls to access IoT device dashboards safely. Include access control, data flow, and fault tolerance in your design.

## Section D: Applied Case Study (30 marks)

**(10 marks)** A pet IoT startup experiences delays in data synchronization between collars and its web dashboard.
- Diagnose potential bottlenecks in the physical, network, and application layers.
- Suggest optimizations (protocol tuning, caching, edge computing).

**(10 marks)** You are asked to evaluate the scalability of a smart farm network with 10,000 sensors.
- What metrics would you monitor?
- How would you redesign the architecture to handle exponential data growth?

**(10 marks)** Discuss how AI-driven network optimization can enhance IoT data transmission in PetSmart. Provide one example where predictive analytics improves QoS or reduces downtime.
